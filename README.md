**Introduce about my project**

WordQuiz is my project which is a program that makes us guess the word.
It makes the list of the words, and by guessing the word, it leads to  our knowledge improvement.

## Installation

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:

    'git clone https://github.com/HyeongJun1125/WordQuiz.git'
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    Since we don't have any directories,we can omit this step.
3. Compile the program:
    
    gcc -o wordquiz wordquiz.c
    
4. Run what you compiled

    ./wordquiz



## Contributing Guidelines

It has some problems that have to be solved.
As I already fixed, it had a problem when we wrote the wrong input,
it creates an unterminate loops and did the unnormal exit when it exceeds
the system memory.
And also, we should need more words in .txt file and the gcc compiler to execute them.

So, we need you guys to fix the error like <unable to use the funcion>
, <invalid type to execute the program>, and <wrong inputs that lead to unusual program>

It is a project in my major class in CHUNGBUK National University.
And it has already a contributors who are my team named GyuHyeon and MinChan.
I appreciate their efforts.
